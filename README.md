# Liveness-CNN-detection
Eng:A pre trained open-source liveness detection model used as a prerequisite for any face detection or recognition system. CHN：一个训练好的开源活体检测模型，用于任意人脸检测或识别系统的前置条件，代码和模型仅为调试中产品  
The code and model are only debugging products, and you can adjust the code framework according to your own needs. I searched online and found that there are almost no free open-source liveness detection models available in China. So, I searched for information and created one myself. Of course, this is a pre condition for face recognition, so the focus of the code is not here. I will update some tutorials for full stack applications in the future.  
大家可以根据自己的需求调整代码框架，我搜了一下网上几乎没有，哦中国的网上几乎没有免费的活体检测开源模型，就自己查询资料制作了一款，当然我这里是用于人脸识别的前置条件，所以代码重心并不在此，后续会更新一些应用到全栈的教程。
